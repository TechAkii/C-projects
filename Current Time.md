 📜 Description
 
    This simple C program retrieves and displays the current system time in HH:MM:SS format using the time.h library.

 🛠 How It Works
 
    🕰️ Fetches the current system time using time(NULL).
    📅 Converts it to a readable format using localtime().
    📢 Prints the time in HH:MM:SS format.
    🚀 Compilation & Execution

  🔍 Example Output
  
    Current Time: 14:30:45
    
  📌 Notes
  
    The output will vary depending on the current system time.
    localtime() returns a struct with time details, including hours, minutes, and seconds.
