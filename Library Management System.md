    Add Book ➕📚
    View Books 👀📖
    Borrow Book 🛒📚
    Return Book 🔄📚
    Save and Exit 💾🚪

    
  Workflow:
  
    The program keeps track of books and their borrowing statuses (borrowed or available).
    The user can choose from a menu of options to add books, view books, borrow, return, or exit.
    The library data is saved to and loaded from a binary file (library.dat) to persist the data even after the program exits.
    
  Key Features:
  
    Dynamic Input Handling: Uses fgets for input to allow spaces in book titles and author names.
    File Handling: Library data is saved in binary format, so it is preserved between sessions.
    ID-based Borrowing: Books are accessed via their unique IDs, making borrowing and returning intuitive.
    To run the program:
    Compile and run the code.
    Choose an option (e.g., adding a book, viewing books).
    The system will handle saving and loading automatically.

    Happy coding! 🎯💻
