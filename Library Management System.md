Workflow:
The program keeps track of books and their borrowing statuses (borrowed or available).
The user can choose from a menu of options to add books, view books, borrow, return, or exit.
The library data is saved to and loaded from a binary file (library.dat) to persist the data even after the program exits.
Key Features:
Dynamic Input Handling: Uses fgets for input to allow spaces in book titles and author names.
File Handling: Library data is saved in binary format, so it is preserved between sessions.
ID-based Borrowing: Books are accessed via their unique IDs, making borrowing and returning intuitive.
To run the program:
Compile and run the code.
Choose an option (e.g., adding a book, viewing books).
The system will handle saving and loading automatically.
Happy coding! 🎯💻
